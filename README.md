# **Lab Project 3: Wordle Game**

## **Description**

This project is a **Python implementation** of the popular game **Wordle**, created as part of an educational lab assignment at **ENSAT 2024/2025**. Wordle is a word-guessing game where players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word. Feedback is provided after each guess using colors:

- ðŸŸ© **Green**: The letter is correct and in the right position.  
- ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow**: The letter is correct but in the wrong position.  
- ðŸŸ¥ **Red**: The letter is not in the word.

---

## **Features**

The project is modular and divided into several components for better organization:

- **`display.py`**: Manages the game's visuals and feedback display.  
- **`word_choice.py`**: Fetches words from `words.txt` and selects a random word.  
- **`validate_guess.py`**: Validates player inputs to ensure they follow the rules.  
- **`wordle.py`**: Contains the main logic for gameplay and feedback generation.

All valid five-letter words are stored in `wordle_package/assets/words.txt`.

## **Game Rules**

1. You have **six attempts** to guess the mystery word.  
2. Each guess must be a **valid five-letter word**.  
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback:  
   - ðŸŸ© **Green**: Correct letter in the correct position.  
   - ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow**: Correct letter, wrong position.  
   - ðŸŸ¥ **Red**: Incorrect letter.

## **Example Gameplay**

Imagine the mystery word is **"apple"**. Here's how a game might progress:

| **Attempt** | **Result**        | **Explanation**                                              |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **grape**   | ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¨ ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¥   | "p" is correct and in the right position (ðŸŸ©). "a" is correct but misplaced (ðŸŸ¨). |
| **plate**   | ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¥ ðŸŸ¥   | "p" and "l" are now in the correct positions (ðŸŸ©).            |
| **apple**   | ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ© ðŸŸ©   | All letters are correct, you win! ðŸŽ‰                         |

## **Customization**

- To add more words, update the `assets/words.txt` file with new five-letter words.  
- Each word must appear on a new line.
